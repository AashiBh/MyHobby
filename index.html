  <h1>MY FAVORITE HOBBY</h1>

        <h3>I like reading books because they never ever tell you "do this, then you can read the juicy and exciting story inside me". They hold exciting stories. I love reading because it make you imagine things that you might (most possibly not in my case) see in the real world out there. And if you want a little escape from the real world for any reason you always have your book right next to you to go into a total world of imagination. Books are my best friends. My favorite genre is FANTASY. You can imagine all you want. Look there's a flying pig! Look has that person just jumped out of the sea dry? OMG did he just jump into the sea from a 5 story building??! So you can imagine a flying pig. All these snatches are from PerseusJackson. Another set of magical books are Harry Potter, Kane Chronicles, Chronicles of Narnia, etc.You can get lost in a book, but you can't get lost in the real world. There are many things in books that you get to learn, that you can't ever learn in realy life. I also like writing but I haven't put it as my favorite hobby as readin is, but I do like writing.</h3>
